Lift = [Coefficent of lift] * ( [.5 rho (air density)] * [velocity^2] * [wing surface area])

********** Lift **********
- newton 
- what the fuck's a newton
- "the SI unit of force. It is equal to the force that would give a mass of one 
	kilogram an acceleration of one meter per second per second."
- acceleration (added to velocity) / mass of plane? (in kg)
- thanks, google

********** Coefficent of Lift **********
- always between 0 and 2
- Angle of attack and wing shape make this up  
- Usually found via experimentation
- Fuck it, boeings uses .52 I fucking guess

********** Air Density **********
-kilogram/meter^3 

********** Velocity **********
- meter/second

********** Wing Surface Area **********
- meter^2
- Can also be made up for our purposes, until later
